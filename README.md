Some of my projects created mainly in 2019 and beginning of 2020 (both individual and group projects).

1. These projects were created from scratch by me or team from Coderscamp (open web dev camp)
- TripExpenses App (group project) https://tripexpenses.herokuapp.com/
- BooksApp (group project) https://bookstore-seven.herokuapp.com/
- Factfullness Quiz (individual project) https://natkalia.github.io/factfulness-quiz-coderscamp/

2. These projects were created by me during Kodilla webdev bootcamp, so in some cases part of code and design was not fully created by me. Anyway I was trying to put also some additional custom features to most of these projects :)
- TODO list with React https://list-react-redux.herokuapp.com/
- Italian restaurant https://italian-restaurant.herokuapp.com/
- Dystopias JS page https://natkalia.github.io/dystopias-kodilla-6.2/
